Note: Generated with Claude, significantly harder than the other ones, also uses async stuff

Sample Interview Problem: Real-time Weather Analytics Pipeline
Problem Statement
You're building a data pipeline for [redacted]'s cloud cost monitoring system. In this exercise, you'll create a Python program that:

Fetches weather data from multiple global data centers
Processes and analyzes this data
Generates insights about potential cost impacts
Handles error cases gracefully

Requirements

Use the OpenWeatherMap API (or similar weather API) to fetch current weather data for 5 different global locations where cloud data centers might be located
Process the data to extract:

Temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Weather conditions


Analyze the data to:

Identify locations experiencing extreme conditions
Calculate cooling costs based on temperature
Estimate risk factors for each location


Implement proper error handling and retry logic
Create a summary report of your findings

Additional Challenges

Implement rate limiting for API requests
Add data validation to ensure the API responses are as expected
Use asyncio to make concurrent API requests efficiently
Implement caching to reduce API calls for repeated requests
Unit test your code with mocked API responses
