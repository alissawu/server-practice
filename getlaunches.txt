Prompt: Analyze SpaceX Launch Data

Question:

You’re given JSON data from the SpaceX Launches API ("https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches"). 
Each object in the list represents a single launch and includes nested information such as launch success, payloads, rocket used, failure reasons, and links to media.

Write a Python script that:

Fetches all launches from the SpaceX API.
Filters the launches that failed.
For each failed launch, prints:
🚀 Launch name
📅 Date of launch
❌ Reason for failure (if any)
🔗 A link to the launch’s article or webcast (if available)
Finally, output the total number of failed launches.
